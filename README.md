# Linus
Linus Music Recommendation System
Just a short summary of the application. I will add a more detailed description of the application later

networkAlgorithm.py contains the mail algorithm

linusServer.py contains the server implementation

utilities.py contains functions that will be used often

Most of the other .py files are run once to get features/info from songs database. This data is stored in files and is read
from there.
